# Weather station API with database

This is a small Python portfolio project that collects weather data from a raspberrypi sensehat.

- Saving and Retrieving data from a MongoDB database
- Hosts a web interface for the data
- Displays the status by using an 8x8 pixel grid
- Exposes an API for 3rd party use

I didn't have a Python portfolio project so I decided to create this in an afternoon.
